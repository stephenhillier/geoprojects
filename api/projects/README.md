# Projects module
The projects application contains endpoints and handlers for interacting with `project` records.
Each project contains a collection of data related to one project or contract and is analogous to
a "project folder" containing files and reports.

In Earthworks, project data is divided into field, lab, and deliverable   data (see the `field` and `lab` modules).
